h1. Customs

The data import / export gem.

h2. Goals

To be able to import from and export to data stores that are not stored in your preferred format.
The plan is to generate import/export profiles that are a ruby dsl.  Your datastore can then read these
profiles and import or export from a remote database, csv, or spreadsheet.  Ideally these profiles can
be generated via a web interface to avoid even having to write them.  You would upload a sample import,
or give it a db connection to the store to get an idea of its schema, and then generate a profile by
connecting the source _attribute_ to the destination _attribute_.

Example usage can be found in the spec/fixtures folder.
